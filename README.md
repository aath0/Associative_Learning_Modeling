# Associative_Learning_Modeling
Functions to analyze and model skin conductance and pupil size response data during fear conditioning experiments.

### Analysis of skin conductance & pupil size responses (SCR & PSR)
SCR and PSR data can be imported in matlab using [PsPM](http://pspm.sourceforge.net/) and functions that can be found [here](/RawDataAnalysis/import_SCR.m). 
Extraction of anticipatory amplitude of SCR is based on dynamic causal models (DCMs), and the code for that can be found [here](/RawDataAnalysis/compute_dcm.m).
